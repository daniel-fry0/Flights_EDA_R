  <h1>Hi, I'm Daniel</h1>
  <p>If you've landed here you've probably already seen my CV, so I won't go into personal details again. Feel free to browse my personal projects below. Alternatively, if you somehow ended up here without seeing my CV, you can find it here.</p>

        This is the second project for my Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics through Sydney University. I found the dataset myself and came up with the brief that I would investigate. It is an investigation
        into which disease categories if any have a disproportionate impact on one gender over another. It then identifies specific diseases that are responsible for this, and further explores what contribution
        specific risk factors make in the mortality for this disease. Recommendations are made for the client based on these findings.

        <p>
          As a passion project alongside my teaching, I was curious as to whether student assessment results through year 11 and 12 could be used to accurately predict HSC band outcomes at the end of year 12. 
          This project was the beginning of a learning journey for me, and taught me the funadmentals of programming, modelling and machine learning. The model uses a random forrest regression and was trained on
          4 years of deidentified student data through year 11 and year 12. The model has a mean absolute error of 1.95 and was deployed as a cloud app for my students to access and see how their current assessments 
          and future assessments might affect their eventual HSC outcome.

        <ul>
          <li>Tableau</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        This dashboard was create in the course of my learning to use Tableau. I used publicly available hospital data to present information regarding how length of stay and severity of injury impact on the total cost of stay.
        This dashboard could be utilised to identify outlier hospitals or service areas in terms of particularly long stays or particularly high costs for stays. This data would be a good jumping off point for an investiation into
        hospital efficiency, understaffing levels or underperformance in treatment KPIs.

        <li>Google Sheets Formula Language</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A passion of mine is rock climbing and training for rock climbing. A challenge in my training has always been scheduling and tracking the varied activities and exercises I need to do within the week and across multiple
        training blocks. Using google sheets I created a training planner/tracker that can take inputs in terms of exercises and then allows the user to set the desired number of those exercises per week and then schedule and complete
        them using drop down menus and check boxes. Dynamic visualisations show what percentage of each category has been scheduled for the week and also how much of the weekly training load has been completed. While google sheets may not
        be industry standard in terms of data management, much of the syntax is transferrable from sheets to excel, and I was an excel user long before I was a google sheets user. Sheets was chosen in this case mainly so that I could share 
        the planner with friends.
