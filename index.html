        This report was completed as part of a Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics through the University of Sydney. I chose the dataset and came up with the brief to be investigated. The client was interested in whether there were
          any disaeses that disproportionately affected one gender over another, and what the key risk factors were that contributed to any differences in mortality. Recommendations were made for the client based on these findings in terms of areas
          of greatest impact for policy or funding interventions.

          As a passion project alongside my teaching, I was curious whether assessment results through year 11 and 12 could be used to predict HSC band outcomes at the end of year 12. 
          This project was the beginning of a learning journey for me, and taught me the funadmentals of programming, modelling and machine learning. The model uses a random forrest regression and was trained on
          deidentified student data. The model has a mean absolute error of 1.95 and was deployed as a cloud app for my students to access and see how their current assessments and future assessments might affect 
          their HSC outcome.

      <p>
        Prior to beginning work on the model above, I conducted extensive data cleaning and analysis on student assessment data using excel and python. Using Tableau I created a dashboard which showcased this EDA, displaying distributions
        of student assessment data, band outcomes and correlations between each individual task and eventual HSC outcome. The dashboard utilises custom calculated fields, tooltip icons and dynamic filters to cycle through the various 
        visualisations.

        This dashboard was create in the course of my learning to use Tableau. I used publicly available hospital data to present information regarding how length of stay and severity of injury impact on the total cost of stay.
        This dashboard could be utilised to identify outlier hospitals or service areas in terms of particularly long stays or particularly high costs for stays. This data would be a good jumping off point for an investiation into
        hospital efficiency, understaffing levels or underperformance in treatment KPIs.

        A passion of mine is rock climbing and training for rock climbing. A challenge in my training has always been scheduling and tracking the activities and exercises needed within the week and across multiple
        training blocks. Using Sheets I created a training planner that can take inputs in terms of exercises and then allows the user to set the number of those exercises per week and schedule and complete
        them using drop down menus and check boxes. Dynamic visualisations show what percentage of each category has been scheduled for the week and also how much of the weekly training load has been completed. While google sheets may not
        be industry standard in terms of data management, much of the syntax is transferrable from sheets to Excel, and I consider myself capable in Excel as well.
